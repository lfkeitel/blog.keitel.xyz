Thanks for reading the first post on my new blog! I'm starting this blog as an avenue to document, discuss, and showcase the
ongoing process learning programming, technology, and other things.

This blog won't focus on any specific technology, language, or product family. Instead I intend to discuss anything and everything
tech related. Equally to the best of my ability. Let's see how this goes.
