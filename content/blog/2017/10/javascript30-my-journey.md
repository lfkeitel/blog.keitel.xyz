Although I've been doing basic web development for a few years, I've done a poor job of keeping up-to-date with modern JavaScript
technologies and modern APIs. I've focused more on server-side development and neglected the frontend both JavaScript and CSS.
But this series will deal only with JavaScript. Over the next few weeks I'll be working through a JavaScript course called
JavaScript30.

## What Is JavaScript30

[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) is a free JavaScript course created by Wes Bos. I learned about the course listening
to the [Syntax Podcaast](https://syntax.fm) which is hosted by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski. I highly recommend the podcast by
the way. Thw course is designed for beginner to intermediate JavaScript developers to push them just that little bit
further in their knowledge of this funky language.

The course consists of, get this, 30 exercises each with a video and starter code. Each exercise also has the completed
solution on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30), but where's the fun in looking at the solution before having a go?

## What Is This Series For?

This series of blog posts, all of which will be in the <a href="/categories/javascript30/">JavaScript30</a> category, I'll be documenting my experience as I work
through this course. I'll write about things I learn, difficulties, and any other thoughts I have about the topics
taught. Hopefully these posts can be useful for other people learning JavaScript or even inspire someone, maybe you
the reader, to pick up the language.

## What I Intend To Learn

My intent with this course is to get a better understanding of JavaScript in order to make more complex and feature rich
applications. I'm confident each exercise will provide a brand new challenge that will increase my knowledge and productivity
and I hope you will join me for the ride!
