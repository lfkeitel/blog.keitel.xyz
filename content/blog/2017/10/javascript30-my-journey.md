Although I've been doing basic web development for a few years, I've done a poor job of keeping up-to-date with modern JavaScript
technologies and modern APIs. I've focused more on server-side development and neglected the frontend both JavaScript and CSS.
Over the next few weeks I'll be working through a JavaScript course called JavaScript30 while documenting my progress along
the way.

## What Is JavaScript30

[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) is a free JavaScript course created by Wes Bos. I learned about the course listening
to the [Syntax Podcast](https://syntax.fm) which is hosted by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski. I highly recommend the podcast by
the way. The course is designed for beginner to intermediate JavaScript developers to push them just that little bit
further in their knowledge of this funky language.

The course consists of, get this, 30 lessons each with a video and starter code. Each lesson also has the completed
solution on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30), but where's the fun in looking at the solution before having a go?

## What Is This Series For?

In this series of blog posts, all of which will be in the <a href="/categories/javascript30/">JavaScript30</a> category,
I'll be documenting my experience as I work through this course. I'll write about things I learn, difficulties,
and any other thoughts I have about the topics taught. Hopefully these posts can be useful for other people learning
JavaScript or even inspire someone, maybe you the reader, to pick up the language.

## What I Intend To Learn

My intent with this course is to get a better understanding of JavaScript in order to make more complex and feature rich
applications. I'm confident each lesson will provide a brand new challenge that will increase my knowledge and productivity
and I hope you will join me for the ride!
