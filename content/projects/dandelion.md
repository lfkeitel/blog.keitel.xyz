## Dandelion

Dandelion is a PHP application that does one thing, well two but mainly one. Keep track of when something happens. Dandelion is a simple
web log platform that allows teams, or individuals, keep a running history of what they did in their environment or infrastructure.
This is meant for physical changes such as a new server, swapping a switch, changing UPS batteries, etc.

Dandelion can group a log entry into hierarchical categories to easiy search and find logs about a particular system or area.
The powerful search syntax allows users to search for logs based on the date they were enteried, the title, body, or the whole entry.

## &#264;eesto

&#264;eesto (pronounced Cheesto) is a user status system where users can mark themselves as Available, Out to Lunch, etc.
Administrators can create custom status to choose from.
